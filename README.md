# Title : Text Recognition from low quality License Plates using Deep Learning

## Objective:
- The objective of this assignment is to build an OCR solution for the provided dataset. This specific dataset is normal and HDR readings of license plates.

## Requirements:
1. Use an 80:20 train:test split on the provided dataset
2. Create a model for reading the text using any approaches or tools that you are familiar with
or can learn
3. Use the available test set to check the accuracy of your model

## Dataset:
1. The image dataset ​here​ contains 652 images of cropped license plates with a csv containing annotation as well.
